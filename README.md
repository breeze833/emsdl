# A Simple Practice of CMake and emscripten

CMake is the tool for building a project. It provides a language for
specifying the project properties. Emscripten is a tool for compiling
C/C++ code into JavaScript and WebAssembly.

In this practice, we write a simple SDL program and prepare the CMakeLists.txt
for building the native executable program and the WebAssembly program.

Please refer to the readme files in ``build_native`` and ``build_webpage``
for the building instructions.
